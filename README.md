Wednesday, 11/22 - Made player controller and game manager, and set up a test level.

Thursday, 11/23 - Made player sprite, and player now rotates to match the direction of gravity.

Friday, 11/24 - Made a main menu track for the game, and spent too long trying to figure out how to seamlessly loop it

Saturday, 11/25 - Added sprites for the objective item, black hole, and menu buttons.
	Made Black Hole gameObject which pulls the player towards it if they get close.
	Added restart level function and touching the objective item loads the next level.

Tuesday, 11/28 - Updated Black Hole physics.

Thursday, 11/30 - Made sprites for platforms and spikes, and sound effects for changing gravity and level complete.
	Found free font assets to use in the game.

 Friday, 12/1 - Coded all sound effects in.
	Made Gravity Flipper and Gravity Spinner game objects that flip and spin your gravity respectively.
	Also imported font assets and made a new sprite for the level border.
	Made three new levels that introduce new game mechanics, but Level 4 is currently impossible.

 Sunday, 12/3 - New UI includes the title screen and a background asset for levels.
 	New one-way platforms make Level 4 possible.
  	Made Levels 6 and 7.

Tuesday, 12/5 - The player's color now correctly reflects their ability to change gravity.

Thursday, 12/7, and Sunday, 12/10 - Fixed a game-breaking bug involving collision on one-way platforms.

Monday, 12/11 - Made a new level between 4 and 5 to better introduce the Gravity Flipper. Messed around with Sorting Layers and Order in Layer, but the player and objective item still disappear on the build version.

Tuesday, 12/12 - Fixed the build rendering bug.

Wednesday, 12/13 - Made level 5 better and the Flipper now displays time down to the hundredth of a second.

Thursday, 12/14 - Made levels 9 and 10, which have new bouncy platforms, and the Win Screen. Made "Round and round we go" level more forgiving. Gravity Flipper now has a visual effect on the level border. Also reordered some levels for better progression.

Friday, 12/15 - Added a little jingle that plays on the win screen. Also added a level select menu to the main menu, and a single spike to level 8 to prevent skipping 90% of the level. Added more spikes to level 10 to force the player in the intended direction.
